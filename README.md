# multiagent-search-and-rescue
a centralized multiagent system designed to efficiently search a space to find a target

# Launch
To launch a connection with multiple neetos at the same time, there's a launch file that automatically handles it. To run it:

`ros2 launch search_and_rescue start_multi.py`. To validate that it works, you can run `rqt` or `rviz` and verify that there are multiple Neeto connections.
